I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, advised by [Prof. Christopher Metzler](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~metzler/) and [Prof. Jia-Bin Huang](https://jbhuang0604.github.io/). I received my bachelor's degree from National Taiwan University, where I was advised by [Prof. Homer Chen](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/bio1.php?id=60) and [Prof. Yu-Chiang Wang](https://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/ycwang.html).

My research interests lie in computational photography and 3D computer vision. I aim to explore how integrating computer vision techniques with optics can advance realistic visual experiences.
